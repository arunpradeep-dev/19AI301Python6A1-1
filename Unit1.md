# Q1. 
## The boys Surya and Vijay had been playing switch and swap every time it suited their fancy since they had shared two balls. They had a temporary basket to drop the ball for swapping from each other.
Write a python program to swap the colour of balls between Surya and Vijay


```

x = eval(input())
y = eval(input())
temp = x
x = y
y = temp
print("Swapped values are:",x,y)
```
